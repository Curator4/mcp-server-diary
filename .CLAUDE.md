Summary for Claude Code
Goal: Build an MCP server in Go (from scratch using the official go-sdk) that provides AI access to my Obsidian diary entries.
Diary Structure:

Location: ~/obsidian-vault/themis/
Format: themis/YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-node.md
Example: themis/2025/2025-11/2025-11-29-node.md
Files are markdown with frontmatter-style headers

What to Build:

MCP server using github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk
Communicates via stdio (standard MCP transport)
Start with ONE tool: get_recent_entries(days: int) - returns last N days of diary content

Tool Behavior:

Scan ~/obsidian-vault/themis/*/*/*.md recursively
Parse dates from filenames
Sort by date (most recent first)
Return the full content of the last N days as formatted text

Tech Stack:

Go (I'm comfortable with it)
Official MCP Go SDK
No external deps beyond that if possible

Project Name: mcp-server-diary
Next Steps After Basic Version:

Can add more tools later (search, get specific date, etc.)
Eventually want to separate this from a general vault MCP server
Planning to add RAG later, but start simple with text search

Context: This is a weekend learning project to understand MCP protocol. I'm building personal AI infrastructure and this is the first component. Want to understand it deeply, hence building from scratch rather than using existing Obsidian MCP servers.
